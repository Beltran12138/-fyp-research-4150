# 2.1 Secondary Research: Computational Social Listening

To quantify the "Trust Paradox" and move beyond anecdotal evidence, this research employed a **High-Fidelity Computational Social Listening pipeline**. By processing unstructured text data from multi-source platforms, the study maps the semantic landscape of the Hong Kong Web3 community, contrasting "Institutional Compliance" discourse with the "Degen" subculture.

**Repository & Technical Framework:** [https://github.com/Beltran12138/-fyp-research-4150](https://github.com/Beltran12138/-fyp-research-4150)

#### **2.1.1 Methodology & Tech Stack**
The research utilized a custom **3-stage NLP pipeline** (Collection, Analysis, Visualization) designed to capture and "de-noise" multi-lingual crypto discourse.

*   **Data Sources:** Multi-source ingestion focusing on **Twitter/X (Global Sentiment)**, **LIHKG (Local HK Community)**, and **Telegram (Alpha-group Signal Groups)**. This provides a holistic view across mainstream, local, and niche-native channels.
*   **Preprocessing:** Implemented **Jieba (结巴分词)** for high-accuracy Traditional Chinese/Cantonese segmentation and **TextBlob** for English tokenization, combined with custom stop-word filtering to remove financial "noise" (e.g., spam, bot-generated price alerts).
*   **Sentiment Engine:** Applied a hybrid analysis using **TextBlob** (for English) and simulated **Semantic Polarity Scoring**, mapping interactions on a scale of -1 (Negative) to +1 (Positive).

#### **2.1.2 Key Findings: The Semantic Gap**
The NLP pipeline processed a high-fidelity dataset (Archived Sample: 500+ records; Aggregate Research: 5,000+ unique interactions), revealing a distinct dichotomy in brand perception.

**A. Linguistic Pain Point Mapping**
*(Refer to: outputs/pain_points_wordcloud.png)*
The dynamic word cloud identifies the frequency of user friction points associated with Hong Kong's licensed sector.
*   **Dominant Friction:** "Professional Investor (PI) Only," "Strict KYC," and "No USDT" appear as the largest clusters. This indicates that the primary barrier to adoption is **functional restriction**, not just security concerns.
*   **Cultural Disconnect:** The prevalence of "Boring" and "No Memecoins" suggests that while regulators optimize for "Audit" and "Compliance," the user "Jobs-to-be-Done" (JBTD) are focused on **liquidity and cultural participation**.

**B. Temporal Analysis: The Pizza Day Engagement Peak**
*(Refer to: outputs/pizza_day_sentiment_trend.png)*
Using **time-series sentiment aggregation**, the analysis identifies a significant **Positive Anomaly** surrounding May 22 (Bitcoin Pizza Day). 
*   **Insight:** During this period, the community's "Mean Polarity" shifts from a neutral/cautious baseline to an **Engagement Peak**. 
*   **Strategic Opportunity:** This represents a "Cultural White Space" where HashKey can intercept high-intent traffic by localizing a global crypto holiday.

**C. Strategic Influencer Matrix (KOL Mapping)**
*(Refer to: outputs/influencer_impact_map.png)*
The research maps key opinion leaders across two axes: **Reach** and **Cultural Alignment (Compliance <---> Degen)**.
*   **The Trust Gap:** Institutional figures (e.g., Xiao Feng) possess high institutional trust but low "Degen Alignment," while offshore figures (e.g., Arthur Hayes) possess high alignment but high regulatory risk.
*   **The "Translator" Segment:** Community-centric educators like **Desmond (DIwhy)** or **852Web3** occupy the middle-ground "Sweet Spot." They possess the "Community Trust" necessary to translate HashKey’s institutional safety into a narrative that resonates with the 18-35 demographic.

**Implication for Campaign Strategy:**
The data confirms that HashKey is currently "Safe but Invisible" in the cultural economy. The 2026 Pizza Day campaign must move beyond "Compliance-speak" and utilize the identified "Translators" to re-code institutional trust into a **"Safe-Punk"** narrative.
