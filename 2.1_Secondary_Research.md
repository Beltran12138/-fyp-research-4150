2.1.1 Methodology & Tech Stack
The data collection and analysis pipeline utilized a custom Python script designed to capture multi-lingual (English and Traditional Chinese) crypto discourse.
Data Sources: Thread content from LIHKG & Reddit (Hardware/Software & Finance channels) related to exchange user experiences.
Sentiment Polarity: Applied `TextBlob` and `SnowNLP` to score posts on a scale of -1 (Negative) to +1 (Positive).
2.1.2 Key Findings: The Semantic Gap
The NLP analysis processed a dataset of approximately 5,000 unique interactions (Jan 2025 - Present), revealing a distinct dichotomy in brand perception.

The word cloud visualizes the frequency of negative keywords associated with Hong Kong's licensed exchanges (HashKey/OSL).
Dominant Terms: "Professional Investor Only," "Strict KYC," "No USDT," and "High Fees" appear largest, indicating they are the primary friction points for users.
Cultural Disconnect: Terms like "Boring" and "No Memecoins" highlight the cultural gap. While regulators focus on "Audit" and "Compliance" (smaller, less frequent in user discourse), the community is demanding access to the "degen" economy (memecoins, airdrops).
Implication: HashKey's current value proposition (safety) addresses a regulatory requirement but fails to address the user's primary "jobs to be done" (access to liquidity and high-growth assets).

The sentiment trend chart overlays community sentiment scores against the timeline of May 2025. A clear positive anomaly is observed around May 22 (Bitcoin Pizza Day). Sentiment shifts from "neutral/negative" to "excited/positive."

The scatter plot maps key Hong Kong voices based on Reach (Y-axis) and "Degen" Alignment (X-axis).
The Gap:
- Top Left (High Reach, Low Degen): Institutional figures like Xiao Feng (HashKey) have high reach but low cultural alignment with the youth.
- Top Right (High Reach, High Degen): Figures like Justin Sun or Arthur Hayes dominate the narrative but are often offshore or "too risky" for a compliant brand to partner with directly.
- The "Sweet Spot" (Middle): Community educators like Desmond (DIwhy) or 852Web3 sit in the middle. They possess significant trust ("Community Trust") and moderate "Degen" credibility without being toxic.
Implication: The campaign should not just target the "Whales" (Top Right) but partner with the "Educators" (Middle) who can translate HashKey's institutional message into community language.
